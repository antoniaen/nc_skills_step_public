To study which signals are valued by employers, we randomize several skill signals on resumes of fictitious applicants among which we ask a large representative sample of German human-resource managers to choose. We find that signals in both studied domains – cognitive and social skills – have significant effects on being invited for a job interview. Consistent with their relevance, expectedness, and credibility, different signals are effective for apprenticeship applicants and college graduates. While {GPAs} and social skills are significant for both genders, females are particularly rewarded for {IT} and language skills.

This paper reviews the role of cognitive skills in promoting economic well-being, with a particular focus on the role of school quality and quantity. It concludes that there is strong evidence that the cognitive skills of the population—rather than mere school attainment—are powerfully related to individual earnings, to the distribution of income, and to economic growth. New empirical results show the importance of both minimal and high level skills, the complementarity of skills and the quality of economic institutions, and the robustness of the relationship between skills and growth. International comparisons incorporating expanded data on cognitive skills reveal much larger skill deficits in developing countries than generally derived from just school enrollment and attainment. The magnitude of change needed makes clear that closing the economic gap with developed countries will require major structural changes in schooling institutions.},

First, I exploit the variation over time and across states to identify the effect of an increase in class hours on same-aged students' intelligence scores, using data on seventeen year-olds from the German Socio-Economic Panel. Second, I investigate the influence of earlier instruction at younger ages, using data from the German National Educational Panel Study on high school graduates' competences. The results show that, on average, neither instructional time nor age-distinct timing of instruction significantly improves students' crystallized cognitive skills in adolescence. Yet, there is suggestive evidence that increasing instructional time may benefit male students exacerbating gender differences in numeracy.},

These factors are likely to be largely downstream effects of early-adult general intellectual capacity. Thus, caution is warranted when interpreting their impact or their use as indices of reserve. Because these factors are correlated, each of which may have small effects on later-life cognitive functioning, examining only one factor at a time may inflate its apparent effect. There is evidence that education does help enhance cognitive abilities, but our data are consistent with epidemiologic data suggesting a plateauing of those effects by late adolescence/early adulthood. The need for formal testing of this hypothesis remains, however. The leveling-off phenomenon is consistent with data suggesting that education-related activities in later life must be very intensive to have meaningful effects. It may also suggest that a reduction in later-life cognitive decline and dementia risk actually might begin with improving earlier educational quality and access.},

The data reveal substantial heterogeneity in preferences across countries, but even larger within-country heterogeneity. Across individuals, preferences vary with age, gender, and cognitive ability, yet these relationships appear partly country specific. At the country level, the data reveal correlations between preferences and biogeographic and cultural variables, such as agricultural suitability, language structure, and religion. Variation in preferences is also correlated with economic outcomes and behaviors. Within countries and subnational regions, preferences are linked to individual savings decisions, labor market choices, and prosocial behaviors. Across countries, preferences vary with aggregate outcomes ranging from per capita income, to entrepreneurial activities, to the frequency of armed conflicts.},

There is evidence that high cognitive test scores are likely to result not only from high cognitive skills but also from high motivation and adequate personality traits. This suggests that part of the contribution of cognitive skills to economic growth could be due to personality traits. Across large parts of the literature, there is consensus that non cognitive skills have important effects both on school attainment and on labour market outcomes. These effects might be as important as the effects of cognitive skills. Less consensus exists on the malleability of non cognitive skills, with some arguing that these skills can be altered until the end of teenage years and others claiming that emotional intelligence can be changed at any age. Most of what economists know about the technology of non cognitive skill formation concerns early educational levels, such as preschools and schools. While it is difficult to argue that all relevant skill formation ends before labour market entry, there is scant evidence on the role of the workplace in the maintenance and development of existing skills. Clearly, more research in this area is needed.},

We find only a limited role for tuition policy or family income supplements in eliminating schooling and college attendance gaps. At most 8\% of American youth are credit constrained in the traditional usage of that term. The evidence points to a high return to early  interventions and a low return to remedial or compensatory interventions later in the life cycle. Skill and ability beget future skill and ability. At current levels of funding, traditional policies like tuition subsidies, improvements in school quality, job training and tax rebates are unlikely to be effective in closing gaps.},

The literature establishes that achievement tests do not adequately capture character skills–personality traits, goals, motivations, and preferences–that are valued in the labor market, in school, and in many other domains. Their predictive power rivals that of cognitive skills. Reliable measures of character have been developed. All measures of character and cognition are measures of performance on some task. In order to reliably estimate skills from tasks, it is necessary to standardize for incentives, effort, and other skills when measuring any particular skill. Character is a skill, not a trait. At any age, character skills are stable across different tasks, but skills can change over the life cycle. Character is shaped by families, schools, and social environments. Skill development is a dynamic process, in which the early years lay the foundation for successful investment in later years. High-quality early childhood and elementary school programs improve character skills in a lasting and cost-effective way. Many of them beneficially affect later-life outcomes without improving cognition. There are fewer long-term evaluations of adolescent interventions, but workplace-based programs that teach character skills are promising. The common feature of successful interventions across all stages of the life cycle through adulthood is that they promote attachment and provide a secure base for exploration and learning for the child. Successful interventions emulate the mentoring environments offered by successful families.},

Unobserved endowments drive the correlations in unobservables across choice and outcome equations. We proxy these endowments with numerous measurements and account for measurement error in the proxies. For each schooling level, we estimate outcomes for labor market, health, and social outcome. This allows us to generate counter-factual outcomes for dynamic choices and a variety of policy and treatment effects. In our framework, responses to treatment vary among observationally identical persons and agents may select into the treatment on the basis of their responses. We find important effects of early cognitive and socio-emotional abilities on schooling choices, labor market outcomes, adult health, and social outcomes. Education at most levels causally produces gains on labor market, health, and social outcomes. We estimate the distribution of responses to education and find substantial heterogeneity on which agents act.},

This association between mortality and education may partly be explained by confounding factors, including cognitive ability. Cognitive ability may also be affected by education so that it becomes a mediating factor in the causal chain. In this paper we estimate the impact of education on mortality using inverse probability weighted ({IPW}) estimators, using either cognitive ability as a selection variable or as a mediating variable. We develop an {IPW} estimator to analyse the mediating effect in the context of survival models. Our estimates are based on administrative data, on men born in 1944-1947 who were examined for military service in the Netherlands between 1961-1965, linked to national death records. For these men we distinguish four education levels and we make pairwise comparisons. From the empirical analyses we conclude that the mortality differences observed by education are only attributable to education effects for highly educated individuals. For less educated individuals the observed mortality gain is mainly attributable to differences in cognitive ability.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the recent literature on measuring and boosting cognitive and noncognitive skills. The literature establishes that achievement tests do not adequately capture character skills{\textbar}personality traits, goals, motivations, and preferences that are valued in the labor market, in school, and in many other domains. Their predictive power rivals that of cognitive skills. Reliable measures of character have been developed. All measures of character and cognition are measures of performance on some task. In order to reliably estimate skills from tasks, it is necessary to standardize for incentives, effort, and other skills when measuring any particular skill. Character is a skill, not a trait. At any age, character skills are stable across different tasks, but skills can change over the life cycle. Character is shaped by families, schools, and social environments. Skill development is a dynamic process, in which the early years lay the foundation for successful investment in later years. High-quality early childhood and elementary school programs improve character skills in a lasting and cost-effective way. Many of them beneficially affect later-life outcomes without improving cognition. There are fewer long-term evaluations of adolescent interventions, but workplace-based programs that teach character skills are promising. The common feature of successful interventions across all stages of the life cycle through adulthood is that they promote attachment and provide a secure base for exploration and learning for the child. Successful interventions emulate the mentoring environments offered by successful families.},

	abstract = {Increasing wealth provides key motivation for students to forgo earnings and struggle through exams. But, as we argue in this paper, schooling generates many experiences and affects many dimensions of skill that, in turn, affect central aspects of individuals' lives. Schooling not only affects income, but also the degree to which one enjoys work, as well as one's likelihood of being unemployed. It leads individuals to make better decisions about health, marriage, and parenting. It also improves patience, making individuals more goal-oriented and less likely to engage in risky behavior. Schooling improves trust and social interaction, and may offer substantial consumption value to some students. We discuss various mechanisms to explain how these relationships may occur independent of wealth effects and present evidence that nonpecuniary returns to schooling are at least as large as pecuniary ones. Ironically, one explanation why some early school leavers miss out on these high returns is that they lack the very same decision-making skills that more schooling would help improve.},

	shorttitle = {The Impact of Education on Personality},
	abstract = {This paper investigates the short-term effects of a reduction in the length of high school on students' personality traits using a school reform carried out at the state level in Germany as a quasi-natural experiment. Starting in 2001, academic-track high school (Gymnasium) was reduced from nine to eight years in most of Germany's federal states, leaving the overall curriculum unchanged. This enabled students to obtain a university entrance qualification (Abitur) after a total of only 12 rather than 13 years of schooling. We exploit the variation in the length of academic-track high school over time and across states to identify the effect of schooling on students' Big Five personality traits and on their locus of control. Using rich data on adolescents and young adults from the German Socio-Economic Panel ({SOEP}) study, our estimates show that shortening high school caused students on average to be more extroverted and less emotionally stable. Our estimates point to important heterogeneous effects. In addition to differences between East and West Germany, we find that male students and students from disrupted families showed stronger personality changes following the reform: they became more agreeable and more extroverted, respectively. We conclude that the educational system plays an important role in shaping adolescents' personality traits.},

The results are robust to alternative definitions of the time preference measures but sensitive to changes in samples and specifications.

In this study, we make the first attempt to investigate the causal effects of education on risk aversion by examining the British education reform of 1972, which increased the duration of compulsory schooling from age 15 to age 16. Using regression discontinuity design, we find that this additional year of schooling increases the level of risk aversion, which is contrary to previous findings in the literature, and we also find that this result is particularly strong for individuals with less education. This positive causal effect of education on risk aversion might alleviate concerns regarding the endogeneity/reverse causality issue when using risk aversion as an explanatory variable for decisions about education; the sign would remain credible because the coefficients are underestimated.},

Taking only the instances where all three judges agree, we find 141 words or 47 per cent of the list, whereas 6.25 per cent represents the chance expectation. Examining this average agreement more closely we next determine the peculiarities of each individual judge when his placements are compared with those of the other two judges. This analysis calls attention to perhaps the principal source of unreliability, namely the tendency of each judge to have a mental set of "leniency" favoring the inclusion of marginal or doubtful terms in one column rather than another. Four outside judges selected 130 of the 300 terms as strange and unfamiliar to them. The agreement of the three editors for this group of terms averaged only 45 per cent, as against 47 per cent for the total list, and 48 per cent for the remaining 170 more familiar terms. Apparently established usage and familiarity enhances but slightly the reliability of the placement. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Measured personality is interpreted as a construct derived from an economic model of preferences, constraints, and information. Evidence is reviewed about the “situational specificity” of personality traits and preferences. An extreme version of the situationist view claims that there are no stable personality traits or preference parameters that persons carry across different situations. Those who hold this view claim that personality psychology has little relevance for economics. The biological and evolutionary origins of personality traits are explored. Personality measurement systems and relationships among the measures used by psychologists are examined. The predictive power of personality measures is compared with the predictive power of measures of cognition captured by {IQ} and achievement tests. For many outcomes, personality measures are just as predictive as cognitive measures, even after controlling for family background and cognition. Moreover, standard measures of cognition are heavily influenced by personality traits and incentives. Measured personality traits are positively correlated over the life cycle. However, they are not fixed and can be altered by experience and investment. Intervention studies, along with studies in biology and neuroscience, establish a causal basis for the observed effect of personality traits on economic and social outcomes. Personality traits are more malleable over the life cycle compared with cognition, which becomes highly rank stable around age 10. Interventions that change personality are promising avenues for addressing poverty and disadvantage.},

The methodology and results provided in the paper can also potentially provide a model for researchers who have specific requirements and want to design their own modules.

	abstract = {The importance of intellectual talent to achievement in all professional domains is well established, but less is known about other individual differences that predict success. The authors tested the importance of 1 noncognitive trait: grit. Defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals, grit accounted for an average of 4\% of the variance in success outcomes, including educational attainment among 2 samples of adults (N=1,545 and N=690), grade point average among Ivy League undergraduates (N=138), retention in 2 classes of United States Military Academy, West Point, cadets (N=1,218 and N=1,308), and ranking in the National Spelling Bee (N=175). Grit did not relate positively to {IQ} but was highly correlated with Big Five Conscientiousness. Grit nonetheless demonstrated incremental predictive validity of success measures over and beyond {IQ} and conscientiousness. Collectively, these findings suggest that the achievement of difficult goals entails not only talent but also the sustained and focused application of talent over time.

	isbn = {978-1-57230-881-7},
	abstract = {The notion that the manner in which a person routinely processes situational stimuli has a dramatic impact on that person's production of aggressive behavior is intuitively appealing and has guided numerous intervention attempts to treat children with conduct disorder (e.g., Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, 1999; Hudley \& Graham, 1993; Kazdin, Siegel, \& Bass, 1992; Lochman \& Lenhart, 1995). The underlying premise is that psychotherapeutic intervention might directly change how a person thinks and feels, and therefore indirectly alter how that person behaves. These interventions are based on the hypothesis that one's stylistic pattern of processing social information causes one's display of aggressive behavior. But what is the scientific status of this hypothesis? The current chapter addresses this question. Although intuitively appealing, the hypothesis that processing patterns cause aggressive behavior is extraordinarily difficult to prove with reasonable scientific rigor. Problems arise in finding a valid "window" into mental processes, in experimentally manipulating those processes, and in rebutting alternate explanations for any empirical correlation between mental processes and behavioral output. The purposes of this chapter are to pose testable hypotheses and to evaluate existing empirical findings that address those hypotheses. Finally, future studies are proposed that could refine the state of knowledge in this area. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2023 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

A sample of 2051 university students, comprising samples from Australia (n=262), New Zealand (n=260), the {USA} (n=475), Japan (n=359), Hong Kong (n=281) and Taiwan (n=414) was administered the {DMQ}. Factorial validity of the instrument was tested by confirmatory factor analysis with {LISREL}. Five different substantive models, representing different structural relationships between the decision-coping patterns had unsatisfactory fit to the data and could not be validated. A shortened instrument, containing 22 items, yielded a revised model comprising four identifiable factors–vigilance, hypervigilance, buck-passing, and procrastination. The revised model had adequate fit with data for each country sample and for the total sample, and was confirmed. It is recommended that the 22-item instrument, named the Melbourne {DMQ}, replace the Flinders {DMQ} for measurement of decision-coping patterns. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We show that given mild regularity assumptions, instrumental variables independence assumptions identify a weighted average of per-unit causal effects along the length of an appropriately defined causal response function.

The laws generated dramatic kinks with small jumps in educational attainment across cohorts. Using a regression probability jump and kink design, our results show that one year of schooling reduces mental health disorders by 0.09 standard deviations. Better-educated individuals are significantly less likely to have felt depressed, nervous or agitated in the past month and less likely to feel hopeless about the future, that everything is difficult or that life is meaningless. The positive effects of education on mental health are more profound for females and individuals from rural areas. Our mechanism analysis suggests that education-induced resources, cognitive skills, and social integration play significant roles in the effects of education on mental health outcomes in the long run; in total, they can explain more than 60\% of the education gradient.},

Drawing a distinction between the effects of wealth (measured by expenditures per capita) and credit constraints, we find that the former improves learning while the latter reduces educational investments. We find evidence of a story of gender bias in which academically weak girls are more likely to drop out in primary school while most boys continue on to junior secondary school. Women's empowerment reduces the likelihood of dropping out but does not affect other outcomes. Finally, our measures of school quality have some effect on the duration of primary school enrollment but not on learning.},

	abstract = {In this paper I examine the path that education in Ghana has taken in the last fifty years for significant milestones, achievements and challenges in relation to nation building and socioeconomic development. I begin by mapping out the vision of education at the time of independence and discuss the new policies and choices that were made. Next, I highlight the changes in the late 60s to the period from the 1970s to the mid 1980s when education went into sharp decline, and the issues which informed its revival. From 2000, a newly elected government initiated a review of education reforms in the country. This review introduced the latest round of educational changes. I shall highlight the content of these reforms and their potential to contribute to Ghana’s aspiration to become a middle-level income by 2020. In the paper, I offer a critique of the progress and challenges of educational development and outline the new challenges Ghana faces as it strives to make education a major contributor to its development aspirations. Although, this paper focuses on Ghana, there are obviously some implications and messages for countries in sub-Sahara Africa since many of them have shared similar aspirations as Ghana.},

	abstract = {Most low-and middle-income countries have implemented mass education reforms in the last few decades. Demographers and policymakers have posited that mass schooling would enhance women’s autonomy and, therefore, accelerate population transformations in the Global South. However, gains in women’s schooling may have unexpected implications for female autonomy in contexts where hypergamy norms—the ideal that men should marry down and women should marry up in education and other markers of status—are still dominant. This study addresses difficulties in evaluating the causal impact of additional education on women’s autonomy by leveraging the timing of compulsory schooling reforms in three Latin American countries: Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru. Using Demographic and Health Surveys, I implement an instrumental variable design using random exposure to compulsory schooling laws as an instrument for years of education. Results show that for women who entered the school system as a result of compulsory reforms, further schooling decreased their level of autonomy in all countries—especially among women from rural Bolivia and Peru. Additional analyses suggest these results are explained by changes in the selection into schooling and the formation of unions defying hypergamy norms. Together, these findings highlight the importance of examining the returns to mass schooling considering population heterogeneity and the contextual meaning of women’s education.},

	title = {When is {TSLS} Actually {LATE}?},
	abstract = {Linear instrumental variable estimators, such as two-stage least squares ({TSLS}), are commonly interpreted as estimating positively weighted averages of causal effects, referred to as local average treatment effects ({LATEs}). We examine whether the {LATE} interpretation actually applies to the types of {TSLS} specifications that are used in practice. We show that if the specification includes covariates—which most empirical work does—then the {LATE} interpretation does not apply in general. Instead, the {TSLS} estimator will, in general, reflect treatment effects for both compliers and always/nevertakers, and some of the treatment effects for the always/never-takers will necessarily be negatively weighted. We show that the only specifications that have a {LATE} interpretation are "saturated" specifications that control for covariates nonparametrically, implying that such specifications are both sufficient and necessary for {TSLS} to have a {LATE} interpretation, at least without additional parametric assumptions. This result is concerning because, as we document, empirical researchers almost never control for covariates nonparametrically, and rarely discuss or justify parametric specifications of covariates. We develop a decomposition that quantifies the extent to which the usual {LATE} interpretation fails. We apply the decomposition to four empirical analyses and find strong evidence that the {LATE} interpretation of {TSLS} is far from accurate for the types of specifications actually used in practice.},

We extend the analysis beyond standard metrics of firm performance such as revenue and growth to study intermediate investments, including product innovation, worker training, and adoption of workplace safety measures that are potentially conducive to observed firm performance. Our results show that innovativeness and locus of control are positively correlated with revenue while risk aversion predicts lower revenue. Risk aversion is positively correlated with the adoption of safety measures. Innovativeness, as expected, is associated with an increased probability of product innovations. An internal locus of control predicts higher probability of investments, innovations and worker training. Heterogeneity analyses indicate that innovativeness and risk aversion matter more for firm outcomes in provinces characterized by better business climate. Our results are robust to a variety of checks. We contribute to a nascent and rapidly growing literature on the importance of managerial capital by shedding light on the role of managerial personality characteristics for decision-making in firms in a dynamic transition economy.},

Analyzing longitudinal data on rural children from one of China’s poorest provinces, we find that both cognitive and noncognitive skills, measured when children are 9–12, 13–16, and 17–21 years old, are important predictors of whether they remain in school or enter the work force at age 17–21. The predictive power of specific skill variables differ between boys and girls.

We focus on estimation by local linear regression, which was shown to have attractive properties (Porter, J. 2003, “Estimation in the Regression Discontinuity Model” (unpublished, Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin, Madison)). We derive the asymptotically optimal bandwidth under squared error loss. This optimal bandwidth depends on unknown functionals of the distribution of the data and we propose simple and consistent estimators for these functionals to obtain a fully data-driven bandwidth algorithm. We show that this bandwidth estimator is optimal according to the criterion of Li (1987, “Asymptotic Optimality for Cp, {CL}, Cross-validation and Generalized Cross-validation: Discrete Index Set”, Annals of Statistics, 15, 958–975), although it is not unique in the sense that alternative consistent estimators for the unknown functionals would lead to bandwidth estimators with the same optimality properties. We illustrate the proposed bandwidth, and the sensitivity to the choices made in our algorithm, by applying the methods to a data set previously analysed by Lee (2008, “Randomized Experiments from Non-random Selection in U.S. House Elections”, Journal of Econometrics, 142, 675–697) as well as by conducting a small simulation study.},

	abstract = {In the regression-discontinuity ({RD}) design, units are assigned to treatment based on whether their value of an observed covariate exceeds a known cutoff. In this design, local polynomial estimators are now routinely employed to construct confidence intervals for treatment effects. The performance of these confidence intervals in applications, however, may be seriously hampered by their sensitivity to the specific bandwidth employed. Available bandwidth selectors typically yield a “large” bandwidth, leading to data-driven confidence intervals that may be biased, with empirical coverage well below their nominal target. We propose new theory-based, more robust confidence interval estimators for average treatment effects at the cutoff in sharp {RD}, sharp kink {RD}, fuzzy {RD}, and fuzzy kink {RD} designs. Our proposed confidence intervals are constructed using a bias-corrected {RD} estimator together with a novel standard error estimator. For practical implementation, we discuss mean squared error optimal bandwidths, which are by construction not valid for conventional confidence intervals but are valid with our robust approach, and consistent standard error estimators based on our new variance formulas. In a special case of practical interest, our procedure amounts to running a quadratic instead of a linear local regression. More generally, our results give a formal justification to simple inference procedures based on increasing the order of the local polynomial estimator employed. We find in a simulation study that our confidence intervals exhibit close-to-correct empirical coverage and good empirical interval length on average, remarkably improving upon the alternatives available in the literature. All results are readily available in R and {STATA} using our companion software packages described in Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014d, 2014b).},

	abstract = {The view that the returns to educational investments are highest for early childhood interventions is widely held and stems primarily from several influential randomized trials—Abecedarian, Perry, and the Early Training Project—that point to super-normal returns to early interventions. This article presents a de novo analysis of these experiments, focusing on two core issues that have received limited attention in previous analyses: treatment effect heterogeneity by gender and overrejection of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference. To address the latter issue, a statistical framework that combines summary index tests with familywise error rate and false discovery rate corrections is implemented. The first technique reduces the number of tests conducted; the latter two techniques adjust the p values for multiple inference. The primary finding of the reanalysis is that girls garnered substantial short- and long-term benefits from the interventions, but there were no significant long-term benefits for boys. These conclusions, which have appeared ambiguous when using “naive” estimators that fail to adjust for multiple testing, contribute to a growing literature on the emerging female–male academic achievement gap. They also demonstrate that in complex studies where multiple questions are asked of the same data set, it can be important to declare the family of tests under consideration and to either consolidate measures or report adjusted and unadjusted p values.},

	abstract = {The linear step-up multiple testing procedure controls the false discovery rate at the desired level q for independent and positively dependent test statistics. When all null hypotheses are true, and the test statistics are independent and continuous, the bound is sharp. When some of the null hypotheses are not true, the procedure is conservative by a factor which is the proportion m0/m of the true null hypotheses among the hypotheses. We provide a new two-stage procedure in which the linear step-up procedure is used in stage one to estimate m0, providing a new level q′ which is used in the linear step-up procedure in the second stage. We prove that a general form of the two-stage procedure controls the false discovery rate at the desired level q. This framework enables us to study analytically the properties of other procedures that exist in the literature. A simulation study is presented that shows that two-stage adaptive procedures improve in power over the original procedure, mainly because they provide tighter control of the false discovery rate. We further study the performance of the current suggestions, some variations of the procedures, and previous suggestions, in the case where the test statistics are positively dependent, a case for which the original procedure controls the false discovery rate. In the setting studied here the newly proposed two-stage procedure is the only one that controls the false discovery rate. The procedures are illustrated with two examples of biological importance.},

We find that a ten-year increase in life expectancy implies a 5-percentage point higher discount factor. This relationship emerges for various sub-samples and is unaffected by other determinants including lifetime experiences regarding economic development, institutional quality, or violence.

The results of a simple prototype Ben-Porath model with age-specific survival rates show that an increase in lifetime labor supply is not a necessary, or a sufficient, condition for greater life expectancy to increase optimal schooling. The observed increase in survival rates during working ages that follows from the “rectangularization” of the survival function is crucial for schooling and labor supply. The empirical results suggest that the relative benefits of schooling have been increasing across cohorts of U.S. men born between 1840 and 1930. A simple quantitative analysis shows that a realistic shift in the survival function can lead to an increase in schooling and a reduction in lifetime labor hours.},

Secondly, to examine whether this correlation represents a causal effect, this paper exploits exogenous variation in educational attainment induced by the compulsory schooling reform in 1972. The regression discontinuity estimates suggest that the effects of education on the three measures of trust are all small and statistically insignificant.

While the use of Big Five personality measures is increasingly common across social sciences, their validity outside of western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic ({WEIRD}) populations is unclear. Adopting a comprehensive psychometric approach to analyze 29 face-to-face surveys from 94,751 respondents in 23 low- and middle-income countries, we show that commonly used personality questions generally fail to measure the intended personality traits and show low validity. These findings contrast with the much higher validity of these measures attained in internet surveys of 198,356 self-selected respondents from the same countries. We discuss how systematic response patterns, enumerator interactions, and low education levels can collectively distort personality measures when assessed in large-scale surveys. Our results highlight the risk of misinterpreting Big Five survey data and provide a warning against naïve interpretations of personality traits without evidence of their validity.},

This paper presents results of an experimental validation conducted among low-income individuals in Nairobi, Kenya. We find that quantitative survey measures – hypothetical versions of experimental tasks – of time preference, attitude to risk and altruism are good predictors of choices in incentivized experiments, suggesting these measures are broadly experimentally valid. At the same time, we find that qualitative questions – self-assessments – do not correlate with the experimental measures of preferences in the Kenyan sample.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The relevance of mental health for everyday life functioning and well-being is crucial. In this context, higher educational attainment, higher cognitive level of one's occupation, and more engaging in stimulating leisure activities have been found to be associated with better cognitive functioning in old age. Yet, the detailed pattern of the potential interplay of such a cognitively engaged lifestyle with personality dimensions, such as openness to experience, in their relations to cognitive functioning remains unclear.
{METHODS}: Two thousand eight hundred and twelve older adults served as sample for the present study. Psychometric tests on verbal abilities and processing speed were administered. In addition, individuals were retrospectively interviewed on their educational attainment, occupation, and regarding 18 leisure activities that had been carried out in mid-life. Moreover, openness to experience was assessed.
{RESULTS}: We found that the effect of openness to experience on cognitive functioning was mediated by educational attainment, cognitive level of job, and engaging in different leisure activities. Data were not better described by alternative moderation models testing for interactive (i.e. dependent) effects of openness to experience and cognitively stimulating engagement.
{CONCLUSIONS}: To explain interindividual differences in cognitive functioning in old age, present data are in line with a mechanism in which individuals with high openness to experience may have been more engaged in stimulating activities in early and mid-life. Possibly by increasing their cognitive reserve throughout adulthood, this may finally enhance their cognitive performance level later in old age.},

	abstract = {We study whether a particular socio-emotional skill – grit (the ability to sustain effort and interest towards long-term goals) – can be cultivated through a large-scale program, and how this affects student learning. Using a randomized control trial, we evaluate the first nationwide implementation of a low-cost intervention designed to foster grit and self- regulation among sixth and seventh-grade students in primary schools in North Macedonia (about 33,000 students across 350 schools). The results of this interventions are mixed. Exposed students report improvements in self-regulation, in particular the perseverance-of- effort facet of grit, relative to students in a control condition. Impacts on students are larger when both students and teachers are exposed to the curriculum than when only students are treated. For disadvantaged students, we also find positive impacts on grade point averages, with gains of up to 28 percent of a standard deviation one year post-treatment. However, while this intervention made students more perseverant and industrious, it reduced the consistency-of-interest facet of grit. This means that exposed students are less able to maintain consistent interests for long periods.},

Ethnicity and cultural capital are linked in complex ways with social stratification in Bolivia. In a pluricultural society, the language of instruction and curricular content are among the most fundamental conditions that determine which social or linguistic groups will be excluded or disadvantaged during formal education. Language and content are particularly significant in identity formation and in the shaping of cultural capital. Each contributes to the formation of specific intercultural skills and opportunities for communication within national or international communities. Additionally, each of these components helps determine which educational paths are open for young people, and which activities they can engage with later in life. In Bolivia, various education reforms have attempted to reshape these parameters. Intercultural Bilingual Education and other key aspects of the reforms will be described along with the historical context in which they emerged. Some conclusions are put forward related to their implementation.},

The relationship between Extraversion and life satisfaction was examined using structural equation modeling by regressing life satisfaction on the Big Five traits. Results Extraversion was a unique predictor of life satisfaction in the North American student and nationally representative samples (Study 1, β = .232; Study 2, β = .225; Study 5, β = .217), but the effect size was weaker or absent in other non–North American samples (Germany, United Kingdom, and Japan).

Method We analyzed more than 2,000 German same-sex twin pairs and their siblings. Twins were 17 and 23 years old and siblings were M = 21.6 years old. The sample was balanced regarding gender. We applied multivariate twin-sibling Cholesky models to obtain genetic and environmental correlations and estimated the impact N had on genetic and environmental correlations of {SE} and {LS}. Results The genetic correlation between {SE} and {LS} was .99 and 47\% of this phenotypic correlation was explained by genetics.

	abstract = {Findings on the relationship of experienced sexual abuse and abuse behavior in adulthood are ambiguous. However, associations between experienced abuse and neuroticism as well as between neuroticism and active child abuse have been reported repeatedly. In our study, we compared pedosexual child abusers with consumers of internet child pornography and control subjects with adult-sexual preference with regard to traumatic childhood experience (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, {CTQ}), personality traits ({NEO} – Personality Inventory – Revised, {NEO}-{PI}-R), and sexual abnormalities (Multiphasic Sex Inventory, {MSI}). In an initial analysis, sexual abuse experienced in childhood was not directly linked to sexual abuse behavior in adulthood. However, this relationship was mediated by neuroticism. In a second step, the {CTQ} scales were conflated and, using a structural equation model, direct links between the overall level of abuse experienced in childhood (generally high {CTQ} levels) and sexual abuse behavior in adulthood revealed again the mediation by neurotic personality. We conclude that the overall level of abuse experienced in childhood in general, and less sexual abuse experience in particular, modulates the tendency for child sexual abuse behavior in adulthood. Data suggest that, depending on the resilience of an individual, abuse experience during childhood increases the likelihood of developing neurotic personality traits in later life, which are in turn considered to increase the risk of child sexual abuse in child sex offenders.},

Although some mediators were found, the mental mechanism underlying the effect of childhood maltreatment on aggression seems to remains unclear. In the present study, a temporal path model (represented by hostile attribution bias ({HAB}) and anger rumination) was developed to explain the mediating mechanism in the relationship between childhood maltreatment and aggression. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Word-Sentence Association Paradigm-Hostile, Anger Rumination Scale, and Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire were used in a sample of 973 undergraduate students. Multiple mediation analysis and bootstrapping were conducted via Mplus7 to assess whether {HAB} and anger rumination mediated the association between childhood maltreatment and aggression. The results showed {HAB} (indirect effects = 0.04, 95\% confidence intervals [0.03 0.06]) and anger rumination (indirect effects = 0.10, 95\% confidence intervals [0.08 0.13]) mediated the link between child maltreatment and aggressive behaviours. Pairwise contrast to the indirect effect indicated that anger rumination had a stronger mediating effect than {HAB} (p {\textless} 0.001). We argue that child maltreatment may trigger immediate aggression during a provoking event through {HAB} (an in-process mechanism) and lead to delayed aggression after interpersonal conflict through anger rumination (a post-process mechanism).},

In this study, we explore the effects of micro and macro level factors in explaining an individual's propensity to ‘trust others'. We hypothesize that higher levels of education will lead to higher social trust in individuals, given that the context (country or regions within countries) in which they reside has a sufficiently impartial and non-corrupt institutional setting. However, the positive effect of education on trust among individuals is expected to be negligible in contexts with greater levels of corruption and favoritism toward certain people are more inclined to view the system as ‘rigged' as they become more educated. This multi-level interaction effect is tested using original survey data of 85,000 individuals in 24 European countries. Using hierarchical modelling, we find strong support for our hypothesis. This effect is robust to a number of specifications, and even holds for regional variation of institutional quality ({QoG}) within countries – with the strongest effects being higher education – yet the country effects of {QoG} are strongest.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the impact of school starting age on teenage marriage and motherhood in Vietnam. The investigation uses data from the 2009 Vietnam Population and Housing Census and regression discontinuity methods to identify the causal effects of school starting age on teenage marriage—a first in the literature—and early motherhood. Results show that girls who start school earlier are more likely to marry and/or give birth as teenagers than their counterparts who begin school later. School starting age impacts are heterogeneous across girl subgroups. The deleterious effects of starting school early are particularly pronounced for teenage girls who are members of ethnic minorities, whose mothers have relatively less education, and whose households are relatively poor. Girls that fall into these subgroups are more likely to benefit from a delay in school entry. Government may wish to adopt a more flexible approach to its age at entry regulations to allow disadvantaged girls the option of starting school later.},

We propose a straightforward survey question that allows one to distinguish individuals who give highly reliable answers from those who do not. Our novel indicator can be used to cost-effectively reduce attenuation bias in estimates of cognitive and noncognitive determinants of key life outcomes. Without requiring panel data or repeated measurements, the achieved correction is similar to the most effective reduced-form theory-based approaches in the existing literature. Finally, we clarify the role of effort and self-knowledge in generating measurement error and propose a simple model that rationalizes our findings.},

Women scored significantly lower in Vigilance and higher in Hypervigilance, Buck-passing and Procrastinations than men. Age was significantly related to decision-making style in a U-shaped fashion. The Social Position Index was significantly related to all decision-making styles. The most predictive personality domains regarding decision-making scales were Aggressiveness (negatively) and Activity for Vigilance, and Neuroticism for Hypervigilance, Buck-passing and Procrastination. Age, sex and social position had a small/medium overall effect on the four dimensions of Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.001) with a η$^{\textrm{2}}$ of 0.038, 0.068, 0.050, and 0.031 for Vigilance, Hypervigilance, Buck-passing and Procrastination, respectively. Based on scores on a single factor dimension of the {MDMQ}, the profile of participants with higher scores was characterized by lower age, more likely to be females, lower social position, higher levels of Aggressiveness, less Activity, less Extraversion, and higher Neuroticism.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	shorttitle = {Decision making styles east and west},
	abstract = {Cultural differences in decision making styles were explored using the conflict model of decision
making (Janis and Mann, 1977). Six hundred and seventy three university students in Australia,
Malaysia, and Singapore (Mean age of 20.2 years; {SD}=5.4) were tested on the Melbourne Decision
Making Questionnaire (Mann, Burnett, Radford, and Ford, 1997) to explore cultural, gender, and age
differences between these three countries. Vigilance scores were higher for Malaysian and Australian
respondents compared to Singaporeans. Hyper-vigilance scores were higher for Malaysian while buckpassing
and procrastination scores were lower for Malaysian than for Australian and Singaporean
respondents. Women reported higher scores on hyper-vigilance than males for all three countries.
However, buck-passing scores were significantly higher for women than men only for the Australian
respondents. There were significant positive correlations between vigilant decision making and age,
and significant negative correlations between non-vigilant decision making patterns and age. A country
analysis indicated that these results were significant for the Australian and the Malaysian sample only.
These results are discussed in terms of cultural differences, some of which are reflected in the
Hofstede (2001) comparison of cultures on beliefs, values, and behaviours. Further research is
suggested that may reflect aspects of the global shift towards more common patterns of thinking
across culture, which is influenced by access to media and internet information, as well as increased
travel and commerce in an attempt to understand how local decisions may have global impacts.
Implications of this research suggest that culture may be too broad a concept and that other more
sensitive variable should be examined when conducting cross-cultural research.},

	abstract = {We examined measurement invariance and age-related robustness of a short 15-item Big Five Inventory ({BFI}–S) of personality dimensions, which is well suited for applications in large-scale multidisciplinary surveys. The {BFI}–S was assessed in three different interviewing conditions: computer-assisted or paper-assisted face-to-face interviewing, computer-assisted telephone interviewing, and a self-administered questionnaire. Randomized probability samples from a large-scale German panel survey and a related probability telephone study were used in order to test method effects on self-report measures of personality characteristics across early, middle, and late adulthood. Exploratory structural equation modeling was used in order to test for measurement invariance of the five-factor model of personality trait domains across different assessment methods. For the short inventory, findings suggest strong robustness of self-report measures of personality dimensions among young and middle-aged adults. In old age, telephone interviewing was associated with greater distortions in reliable personality assessment. It is concluded that the greater mental workload of telephone interviewing limits the reliability of self-report personality assessment. Face-to-face surveys and self-administrated questionnaire completion are clearly better suited than phone surveys when personality traits in age-heterogeneous samples are assessed.},
